# Emergency Response Street System: Protecting Women with Smart Technology

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Street Safety System for Women** is a technology-driven solution designed to enhance women’s safety in public areas.  
It uses an **Arduino-based setup** with a buzzer, street lights, siren, and location-tracking module to provide **instant emergency alerts** and **notify authorities in real-time**.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Women often feel unsafe in public areas, especially at night, where traditional methods of seeking help (calling police, mobile apps) may be slow or unavailable.  
There is a need for a **quick-response, location-enabled system** that instantly raises both **public awareness** and **alerts authorities**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide an **easy-to-access emergency buzzer** for women in distress.  
- **Change street light colors** and trigger a **siren** to alert bystanders.  
- **Send real-time location & emergency messages** to the nearest control room or police station.

## ⚙️ System Description
1. **Buzzer Activation** → Woman presses the buzzer on a street pole.  
2. **Street Lights** → Change color to visually indicate an emergency.  
3. **Siren** → Sounds to audibly alert nearby people.  
4. **Location Alert** → Current GPS location + emergency message sent to authorities.
